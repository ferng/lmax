# lmax
* Probably the 20,000th implementation of the LMAX architecture as defined by Martin Fowler in [this article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html).
* Java has introduced streams which means the development complexity of old style multithreaded models has been vastly made redundant LMAX is still an interesting architecture model.
